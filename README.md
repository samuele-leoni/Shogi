# Overview

My goal is to demonstrate my C# skills by creating a simple Shogi game implementation.

This is a simple 2d implementation of Shogi using MonoGame. The game is played on a 9x9 board with 20 pieces per player. The game is played by two players, one with the pieces facing up and the other with the pieces facing down. The game is played by moving pieces around the board and capturing the opponent's pieces. The game is won by capturing the opponent's king.

This projects goal is to showcase my programming skills as well as my understanding of the C# programming language.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Community 2022 and C# with MonoGame to create this project.
